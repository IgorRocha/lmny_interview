# README

This is a simple Ruby on Rails application that displays offers to users, and allows admins to edit those offers.
It was developed using Rails 5.1.4, Ruby 2.4.0, and Twitter Bootstrap 3 (for the home page).

Its released version can be accessed through this URL: https://lmny-igor.herokuapp.com/

The URL to access the admin's page is: https://lmny-igor.herokuapp.com/admins/sign_up

It is not possible to create new users, however the following user is available:

user: igor@lemoney-interview.com
password: lemoney123

Feel free to contact me or open an issue if you have any questions.
